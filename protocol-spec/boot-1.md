# HSYNC Bootnode — wire protocol `boot/1`

> Single source of truth for the bootstrap wire protocol, shared by **all** language
> implementations (`python/`, future `rust/`). Do not fork this spec into
> any implementation directory.

## Transport

- QUIC/UDP, default port **443** (the shared `BOOT_DEFAULT_PORT`; any UDP port is
  selectable with `--port`, and a recommended reachability set (`BOOT_PORT_SET`,
  443 + 53) with `--ports`). **One process, one in-memory routing table, one or
  more UDP listeners** (multi-port; no TCP fallback — zero legacy). Multiple
  listeners share the same routing table so a peer registered via one port is
  visible to a query on another; state sharding across processes is forbidden
  (it would break discovery).
- TLS 1.3 inside QUIC: the exchanged peer list is not readable by ISPs.
- ALPN `hsync-boot/1`.
- NDJSON payloads (one JSON object per line) over bidirectional QUIC streams;
  a client may pipeline several frames back-to-back on one stream and the
  server answers each frame in order.
- **Every frame** carries the common header `{protocol_version, type, ...}`;
  the server routes on `type` and rejects anything else (rigid validator).

## Address validation

- Server requires QUIC `RETRY` + `address_validation_token` before allocating connection state (anti-amplification).
- Per-IP token bucket: ~10 req/s (burst 50). Additional per-IP and per-`(IP, bucket)` limits in §Auth.
- Connection guard: ~30 handshakes/s (burst 100) per IP, a per-IP cap and a process-wide cap on simultaneously-open connections, checked before any handshake work runs.
- QUIC receive windows are bounded (≤32 KiB per stream, ≤128 KiB per connection) so a connection cannot buffer unbounded input.
- Idle connections are dropped after 30 s.

## Trust & identity (ADR-0034)

- The node presents a **self-signed** TLS certificate (ECDSA P-256 key by
  default; RSA/Ed25519 identities remain loadable).
- **Fingerprint** = SHA-256 of the leaf certificate DER, lowercase hex; canonical
  form `sha256:<hex>`. It is the same domain as the `cert_fp` field carried in
  frames, so a client-side pin and a relayed peer `cert_fp` are directly
  comparable.
- **Publication is out-of-band**: `identity show`, the startup banner and the
  service units print the fingerprint; the operator distributes it to clients
  (it is never sent by the node on the wire, so it cannot be learned from the
  protocol itself).
- **Verify before frame (client obligation)**: a client MUST establish the
  certificate fingerprint — via an explicit `--bootnode-fingerprint` pin, the
  opt-in `--bootnode-tofu` store, or an SSH-style confirmation prompt (the
  client-side default) — **before** writing any frame. The
  `bucket_token` travels inside `register`/`query`, so trust is decided pre-write;
  a mismatch closes the connection with zero application bytes sent.
- **Identity persists by default**: the node keeps a self-signed ECDSA P-256
  key+cert (created on first run, reused afterwards) so the fingerprint is stable
  across restarts and rotatable with `identity rotate`; `run --ephemeral` keeps
  the identity in memory instead (no identity file is written). The key+cert is
  the node's only on-disk artifact — never peer data (the no-log invariant is
  unchanged).
- **Rotation**: a client accepts up to two pins (old + new) during the rotation
  window; the trust store records whichever matched. `identity rotate` prints the
  new fingerprint.
- No wire change: `protocol_version` stays `boot/1` — trust is a transport-layer
  concern layered on the unchanged frame contract.

## Frames (client → server on one stream)

| Frame | Payload |
|---|---|
| `register` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"register", cid, bucket, group?, bucket_token?, cert_fp, version, capacity?, endpoints?:[{proto:"tcp"\|"udp", host, port}], connected?, server_ready?, prefer_master?, never_master?, startup_time?, sync_direction?}` |
| `refresh` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"refresh", cid, bucket, group?, bucket_token?, connected?}` |
| `leave` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"leave", cid, bucket, bucket_token?}` |
| `query` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"query", bucket, group?, bucket_token?, limit?}` |

## Frames (server → client)

| Frame | Payload |
|---|---|
| `ack` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"ack", observed_endpoint:{proto:"udp", ip, port}, ttl, server_time, retry_after?}` (STUN-echo) |
| `response` | `{protocol_version:"boot/1", type:"response", peers:[{cid, endpoints:[{proto:"tcp"\|"udp", host, port}], cert_fp, bucket, group?, version, capacity, reachable, server_ready, prefer_master, never_master, startup_time, sync_direction}], count, ttl}` or `{peers: [], count: 0, error:"token_required"\|"rate_limited"\|"overloaded", retry_after?}` |

## Rules

- **No targeted requests**: schema rejects unknown fields (`extra="forbid"`); there is no field for a file path/hash. Agnostic by construction.
- `type` is mandatory: the frame kind is declared, never guessed from the payload.
- **CID**: `^[A-Za-z0-9]{21}$` full-match.
- **Bucket name**: the canonical HSYNC bucket name shared by client, server and
  desktop (`hsync-common` SSOT, `hsync_common.path_validation.is_valid_bucket_name`):
  1–63 characters, alphanumeric with `-` and `_` allowed only in the middle
  (never leading or trailing). It is the same sync bucket the data plane uses,
  so a value outside that rule makes the frame invalid and it is silently
  dropped — the daemon and the client mirror enforce one identical domain.
- **Anonymous `query`**: on an open node anyone with bucket (+group) can list peers; privacy via optional `bucket_token`. On a private node every query must carry a valid token (see §Auth).
- **No-log**: no timestamps/IPs written to disk anywhere in this path.
- Malformed, unknown-`type` or oversized frames are silently dropped (no oracle, no log). An IP that exhausts its malformed-frame budget is dropped before the parser runs, so a parse flood costs no event-loop CPU.
- `refresh` never creates a record: an unknown CID is dropped so the client falls back to `register`.
- **`capacity` (advisory service-capacity hint)**: integer `0..32`, default `0`, carried on `register` and echoed in every `query` peer. It is the number of concurrent peer-download reads the peer declares it can serve right now (`0` = not a seeder). The bootnode copies it onto the record and relays it, but it is **not authenticated** and **not authoritative**: the authoritative value is `serve_slots` on the authenticated data-plane handshake (ADR 0030). The requester may use it only to pre-size concurrency and to skip `capacity=0` peers — never to exclude a live seeder. The bootnode must **not** order the sample by `capacity` (the sample stays random, so a self-declared value cannot buy priority). `refresh` does not carry `capacity` and never mutates it; a changed value requires a new `register`.
- **`reachable`**: derived from `bool(endpoints)` at `register` time — `true` iff the peer advertised at least one listen endpoint (it can act as a data-plane master). A register that carries no endpoint (e.g. the first STUN register, before the public TCP endpoint is known) is advertised with `reachable=false` and a single-element `endpoints` list carrying the observed UDP source; a requester must not treat it as a master. `refresh` never changes `reachable`.
- **`endpoints` (candidate list)**: the `query` response relays the peer's declared `endpoints[]` **verbatim and in full order** (advisory, unauthenticated). When the peer advertised none, the node relays the single observed source endpoint instead. The requester must try the candidates (preferring a host/LAN candidate reachable from its own network) and fall back to the next on failure, so peers behind the same NAT — where the public endpoint is unreachable (no NAT hairpinning) — still connect over the local path. The advertised order is the peer's preference for external reachability; the requester's own-network priority is a client-side policy.
- **`connected` (advisory connected count)**: a non-negative integer `0..2^53` (like `startup_time`, inside the exactly-representable integer range of a JSON number) carried on `register` and `refresh`; `refresh` may update it (the only advisory value `refresh` is allowed to change). The node never interprets it.
- **Election advertisement (`server_ready`, `prefer_master`, `never_master`, `startup_time`, `sync_direction`)**: the same values the client's mDNS TXT record carries (SSOT: `hsync-common` `protocol.p2p` / `protocol.pairing`), relayed verbatim from `register` onto the record and echoed on **every** `query` peer. Defaults when a peer advertises none: `false`, `false`, `false`, `0.0` (unknown) and `bidirectional`. They let a bootnode-discovered peer take part in the client's master election exactly like an mDNS-discovered one: `server_ready` marks the serving incumbent (which outranks a newcomer, even a `prefer_master` one), `prefer_master`/`never_master` are the operator pins (`never_master` nodes are not electable), `startup_time` is the earliest-startup tiebreaker and `sync_direction` expresses the bidirectional preference. The node never interprets them, never orders the sample by them, and they are **not authenticated**: a peer may claim any value, and the data plane authenticates its identity by certificate pinning. Like `capacity`, a changed value requires a new `register` — `refresh` never mutates them.

## Auth — bucket tokens: protected buckets and private nodes

- `bucket_token = HMAC-SHA256(HSYNC_P2P_KEY, "boot/1" || bucket)[:32]` hex (64 characters), optional on register/refresh/query/leave. The wire grammar is enforced by the frame models in **every** implementation: a value that is not exactly 64 lowercase hex characters makes the frame invalid (silently dropped, budgeted by the malformed-frame limit below) — never a failed-token attempt.
- Server-side: operator declares protected buckets (`--protected-bucket`); token compared in constant time (`hmac.compare_digest` Python / `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` Rust).
- Matrix: protected bucket + missing/wrong token → `peers: []`, `error:"token_required"` (uniform — no bucket-existence oracle); correct token → full random `K` sample (default 20, `limit` 1..50). Open bucket: no token needed.
- **Private node** (`--private` / `HSYNC_BOOTNODE_PRIVATE=1`): the protected-bucket check applies to *every* bucket, not only the declared protected set. A bucket with no key loaded is refused exactly like a wrong token (same `token_required` answer, same failed-token budget), so the set of provisioned buckets is not observable either. `leave` is gated in this mode too — an anonymous `leave` would let anyone who knows a `(cid, bucket)` pair spoof a departure; `leave` has no response frame, so a refusal is a silent drop. Startup fails fast (exit code 2) when `--private` is set with zero group keys. The wire format is unchanged: this is a server-side policy.
- **Record ownership (open nodes)**: creating, replacing or renewing a `(cid, bucket, group)` record is honoured only from the source network the record was registered from — the observed source IP (the peer itself or its NAT umbrella) — or, on a protected/private bucket, with a valid token from any source. A `register`, `refresh` or `leave` from any other source is silently dropped: a peer that learns another peer's `(cid, bucket, group)` (e.g. from an anonymous `query`) cannot point that discovery record at different endpoints, keep a hijacked record alive through the victim's own refresh, or evict it. A source IP change leaves the old record to expire with its TTL, after which the peer registers again. On protected/private buckets the token authenticates bucket membership (not a specific CID), so a token holder may replace a record from any source; the private/protected token path also removes every `(cid, bucket)` record on `leave`.
- **Refusal error domain**: a refusal is a `response` with `peers: []`, `count: 0` carrying exactly one of `token_required` (authorization — never reveals whether a bucket exists), `rate_limited` (per-IP or per-`(IP, bucket)` limit; `retry_after` is the seconds until that limiter refills) or `overloaded` (the node is at its host-derived capacity ceiling; `retry_after` is advisory backpressure, not a client abuse signal). An `error` value outside that set is invalid. Implementations must accept all three so a node's capacity answer is never misread as a contract violation.
- Rate limits (in-memory sliding windows), every limiter keyed by source IP so one source cannot exhaust another's budget: `query` 5/min per `(IP, bucket)` (burst 10) plus an aggregate 20/min per IP across every bucket (burst 40, anti-enumeration); `register`/`refresh` 10/min per `(IP, bucket)` (burst 10); failed-token attempts ~5/min per IP. On limit: respond `{error:"rate_limited", retry_after:<s>}` — never silently drop. A silent malformed/unknown-frame budget (~30/min per IP, burst 60) gates the parser: once an IP exhausts it, its frames are dropped before validation, so a parse flood costs no event-loop CPU. Every limiter's tracked-key population is capped from the host resources, so per-IP/bucket churn cannot grow it without bound.
- **Bounded state**: the routing table and the rate-limiter maps have host-derived ceilings (from available RAM and CPU count, with conservative floors). The routing table is bounded both globally and per `(bucket, group)`, so one bucket cannot be filled to the global ceiling and dominate its random sample. A `register` that would exceed either ceiling is refused with `{error:"overloaded", retry_after:<s>}` after a reclamation sweep, never by growing RAM without limit. `overloaded` is **node capacity**, not a client rate limit: a requester should treat it as transient backpressure (retry, or prefer another bootnode), and it must not be counted against the source as abuse. `retry_after` is advisory.

## In-memory routing table

- Key `(cid, bucket, group)` → `{ip_src, udp_port, cert_fp, version, protocol, endpoints[], connected, reachable, capacity, expires_at}`.
- TTL 60 s; client refresh every 30 s; prune every 15 s; response = random `K` sample.
- Responses relay the peer's declared `endpoints[]` in full (fallback: a single-element list with the observed source endpoint).
- RAM-only, bounded by a host-derived record ceiling (no disk persistence, no unbounded growth).
