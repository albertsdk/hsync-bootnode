"""Diagnostics for the bootstrap node: an always-on operational channel plus the
opt-in peer-aware debug stream.

The node is **no-log by design**: nothing peer-related is ever written to disk;
without ``--debug`` no peer data leaves memory at all (invariants and rationale:
``llm-wiki/README.md``, ``llm-wiki/decisions.md`` #25/#36).

``warn_event`` / ``error_event`` — **node health, always emitted** on stderr.
They accept only the non-identifying field allow-list :data:`_PUBLIC_FIELDS`, so
a peer-identifying key raises instead of rendering: the default run stays
peer-free **by construction**.

``debug_log`` / ``debug_event`` — the opt-in full operation log
(``--debug`` / ``HSYNC_BOOTNODE_DEBUG=1``), announced once on the always-on
channel when enabled. It **includes peer identity** (CID, bucket, IP, port) and
exists only on stderr: the process never writes it to disk.

A stderr that disappears (the terminal that carried it was closed, a pipe whose
reader died) disables both channels permanently instead of raising: diagnostics
are best-effort and must never take the node down.

Line format (``timestamp - source[pid] level: message``) for both channels::

    2026-09-30T10:30:45.123Z - hsync-bootnode[1234] debug: register ack cid=… bucket=shared
    2026-09-30T10:30:45.200Z - hsync-bootnode[1234] warn: upnp no igd on lan port=443

The timestamp is the UTC ISO-8601 SSOT (:func:`hsync_common.time_utils.utc_now_iso`)
so the stream stays correlatable with the ``hsync-client``/``hsync-server`` logs;
the pid disambiguates instances sharing one stderr.
