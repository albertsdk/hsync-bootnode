# NOTE: The build context must be the repository root (the parent of
# hsync-rendezvous), because the Python v1 depends on the local ../hsync-common
# package ({path = "../../hsync-common"} from python/). Build via
# `./docker.sh build`, which sets the correct context and passes
# `-f hsync-rendezvous/Dockerfile`.

# console script the entrypoint runs, so its package source must be present too.
