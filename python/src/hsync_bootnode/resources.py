"""Host-resource detection used to size the daemon's in-memory ceilings.

The bootstrap node has no tuning file for its memory bounds: the routing table,
the rate-limiter state and the per-IP connection guard are sized from the
resources the host actually offers (available RAM, CPU count), so the same
binary behaves sensibly on a Raspberry Pi and on a large server without operator
intervention. Detection is read-only and best-effort: every source is guarded so
a sandboxed service unit that hides ``/proc`` still starts with a conservative
fallback. Nothing here is ever written to disk (no-log).

Consumers: ``hsync-bootnode.cli`` (sizes the handler and the connection guard),
``hsync-bootnode.server`` (connection guard) and the white-box tests.
