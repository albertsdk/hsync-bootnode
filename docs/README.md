# HSYNC Bootnode — Welcome

`hsync-bootnode` is the Internet discovery node of the HSYNC sync network: it
tells P2P clients which peers are currently online, without storing anything.
It runs a no-log, zero-knowledge bootstrap service speaking the `boot/1` protocol
over QUIC (UDP port 443): the routing table lives only in RAM, and the node's
own TLS key is its only persistent artifact (an optional readiness PID file is
written only when `--ready-file` is set).

> **Status**: v1 complete and stable (Python). The `boot/1` protocol is versioned
> and specified in `protocol-spec/boot-1.md`.

Run it as-is and it is a **public** rendezvous point. Run it with `--private` and
it becomes the closed rendezvous point of a single community: every frame is
authenticated against a group key, there is no account to create and nothing is
stored — a **private, pseudonymous P2P network over the Internet** whose file data
still flows only between peers.

## How it works in one paragraph

A client registers itself with the node every 30 seconds and gets back an `ack`
with its observed public (NAT-mapped) endpoint; its full endpoint candidate list
is relayed to querying peers. To find peers, clients query the node and receive a
random sample of the currently registered peers in their bucket. Everything lives
in RAM with a 60-second TTL: stop the process and every trace of your network is
gone.

## Requirements

- <img src="assets/os/linux.svg" alt="Linux" width="16" height="16"> <img src="assets/os/apple.svg" alt="macOS" width="16" height="16"> <img src="assets/os/windows.svg" alt="Windows" width="16" height="16"> Linux, macOS or Windows, following the method's own prerequisites
- UDP port 443 (or any other UDP port) reachable from the Internet — the 443
  default is privileged: run as root, grant `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` (the `.deb`
  and systemd unit do), or use a port ≥ 1024 (e.g. `--port 8443`)
- Optional: a UPnP-capable router for zero-touch UDP port mapping (opt in with `--upnp`)
- Optional: a **second** inbound UDP port (e.g. 53) so clients whose network
  blocks UDP 443 can still reach the node — see `--ports` in
  [usage.md](usage.md#run-options)

Python 3.12–3.14 and Poetry are needed **only** for the
[from-source](getting-started-source.md) method: the packages, the Windows
installer and the container image bundle the runtime.

## Start here

This guide is organised as a linear journey; pick the step that matches where
you are.

### 1. Choose your install method

Pick the method that matches your host in the
[Getting Started chooser](getting-started.md): installer script, Docker/Compose,
Debian/Ubuntu package, RPM package, Windows installer, or from source. That page
is the single source of truth for the comparison table.

### 2. Configure the node

- **Public node** — the default; no configuration.
- **Private node / protected buckets** — provision group keys; see
  [usage.md → Private node](usage.md#private-node-authenticated-bootstrap) and
  [usage.md → Group keys](usage.md#group-keys---keys-fd----keys-file).

### 3. Point clients at it

Pass the node to the client's `p2p` command (`hsync p2p <host>`; with the group
key for a private node). The client side is covered by the
[client p2p bootnode guide](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync-client/blob/main/docs/p2p-bootnode.md).

### 4. Operate it

Supervision, readiness and watchdog, log bounds, aggregate metrics, identity
backup and rotation, upgrades and the external reachability probe:
[operations.md](operations.md).

### 5. Reference & internals
