# HSYNC Rendezvous

**HSYNC Rendezvous** is the optional rendezvous node that lets HSYNC peers find
each other over the Internet when they are **not** on the same local network. It
is a stateless, no-log meeting point: it tells P2P clients which peers are
online without ever storing anything, speaking the `rdv/1` protocol over QUIC
(UDP port 443). Think of it as an **address book, not a post office**: it helps
your devices find each other, and the file data always flows directly between
them.

> New to HSYNC? Start with the [HSYNC Ecosystem](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync/blob/main/README.md) for an overview of the platform before deploying a rendezvous.

**Why it exists:** the [HSYNC Client](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync-client)'s
[p2p Mode](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync-client/blob/main/docs/p2p-mode.md)
discovers peers over mDNS on the local network. A rendezvous extends that same
mode across networks: same election, same transport, same peer-to-peer data
plane — only rendezvous differs.

**Status:** v1 **complete and stable** (Python + aioquic): packaged, tested,
and the implementation clients currently talk to. A C port is
planned as an **additive v2** for higher handshake throughput, not a
prerequisite — this is a **multi-language** repository: one protocol, several
implementations sharing the same spec and fixtures (see the
[repository layout](CONTRIBUTING.md#repository-layout)).

> 👉 **Operational Advisory:** the node's TLS identity is its only persistent
> artifact, so distribute its fingerprint to clients (or let them confirm it once
> at the prompt) and pin it — that is what makes a public node verifiably yours.

## What you can do with HSYNC Rendezvous

- **Extend p2p Mode across networks** — let devices that are not on the same
  LAN discover each other, with no central server holding the files.
- **Run a private, closed network** — start the node with `--private` and every
  frame is authenticated against a group key: no accounts, nothing stored.
- **Keep rendezvous stateless and no-log** — clients register and query
  candidates; the routing table is RAM-only with a 60-second TTL, and file data
  never passes through the node.
  
## What it is

HSYNC syncs files peer-to-peer without a central server. On a single local
network peers find each other with mDNS; when devices are spread across the
Internet they need a rendezvous point. The rendezvous is exactly that, and nothing
more:

- Clients **register** their endpoint candidate list (the NAT-mapped public
  address and the local/LAN address) with the node every ~30 s and receive the
  observed endpoint back in an `ack`.
- Clients **query** the node and get a random sample of the peers currently
  registered in their bucket, each with the candidate endpoints the node relays
  (the first four of the registered list); the requester tries the candidates,
  preferring one reachable from its own network.
- The routing table is **RAM-only** with a 60-second TTL: stop the process and
  every trace of the network is gone.

It is a rendezvous point and a **relay of opaque TLS** by default: two peers
that no inbound NAT mapping reaches (mobile carrier-grade NAT, a hotspot behind
a carrier) can still run their data plane through the node, which forwards their
bytes without ever terminating or inspecting that TLS — content, file names and
credentials stay invisible to it. The relay is on by default (disable it with
`--no-relay`); with the relay off, file data flows only between directly
reachable peers.

A node run as-is is a **public** rendezvous point for anyone who knows its
hostname. Started with `--private` it becomes the closed rendezvous point of a
single community instead: every frame is authenticated against a group key, there
is no account to create and nothing is stored — a **private, pseudonymous P2P
network over the Internet** whose file data still flows only between peers. See
[Private node](docs/usage.md#private-node-authenticated-rendezvous) and the
[privacy and anonymity model](docs/usage.md#privacy-and-anonymity-model).

## When you need it

**You need a rendezvous when:**

* your P2P group spans different networks — home ↔ office, two branches, a laptop on mobile data — and you don't want a central server holding the files;
* you want a private, closed group: start the node with `--private`, so every
  frame is authenticated against a group key — see [Private node](docs/usage.md#private-node-authenticated-rendezvous).

**You don't need it when:**

* all your devices are on the same local network — plain `hsync p2p` discovers them via mDNS;
* your devices sync through an [HSYNC Server](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync-server) (Server Mode), which already acts as their meeting point.

## Getting started

Pick an install method and follow it to a running node:

- [Installer script](docs/getting-started-script.md) — one `curl` command and the
  released container image;
- [Docker / Compose](docs/getting-started-docker.md) — manual container setup;
- [Debian package](docs/getting-started-deb.md) — `.deb` with a hardened systemd unit;
- [RPM package](docs/getting-started-rpm.md) — `.rpm` for RHEL/Rocky/Alma/Fedora;
- [Windows installer](docs/getting-started-windows.md) — per-machine service installer;
- [From source](docs/getting-started-source.md) — clone and run.

The [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) chooser compares the methods; point
clients at the node with the `hsync p2p` rendezvous argument (`hsync p2p <host>`)
— see the client
[p2p rendezvous guide](https://github.com/albertsdk/hsync-client/blob/main/docs/p2p-rendezvous.md).

## Design invariants

- **No-log** — the process never writes peer data (IPs, CIDs, timestamps) to
  disk; the only on-disk artifact is the node's own TLS key+cert, kept by default
  (ECDSA P-256, `0600`) so its fingerprint is stable and pin-able across restarts.
  `--ephemeral` replaces it with an in-memory identity for read-only filesystems
  or throwaway nodes. Diagnostics on stderr come in two channels: an always-on,
  **peer-free** operational one (warnings/errors about the node itself) and the
  opt-in `--debug` operation log, the only one that can contain peer identity.
- **No telemetry** — the node never phones home: no usage data, analytics or
  statistics leave the process.
- **Zero-knowledge / protected buckets** — group tokens are HMAC-SHA256
  capabilities compared in constant time; refusals are uniform and never reveal
  whether a bucket exists.
- **Rigid schema** — every `rdv/1` frame rejects unknown fields; malformed
  frames are silently dropped, never reinterpreted.
- **One wire protocol** — `protocol-spec/rdv-1.md` is the single source of
  truth; every implementation must be byte-identical on the wire.

## Security & Vulnerability Reporting

The rendezvous sits at the Internet edge, so security reports are taken seriously.
Please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** rather than a public issue:

See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for supported versions and hardening guidance.

## 🙋‍♂️ A note from the maintainer

This project was born out of the need for a system capable of replicating the contents of a folder from a PC or Android device to a NAS, primarily for backup purposes. Several solutions were already available, but I couldn't find one that met all my requirements. This led to the somewhat questionable decision to develop one from scratch, while also providing an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of programming languages, algorithms, frameworks, and related technologies.

Originally conceived as a hobby project, HSYNC has been under continuous development ever since. I believe it has now evolved to the point where its capabilities are comparable to those of commercial solutions, while also offering some distinctive features. As a result, it may also be suitable for deployment in certain production environments.

HSYNC is a passion project that I primarily develop and maintain in my spare time. Please keep this in mind when interacting with the project: we're all doing our best to build something great together, but this is not a paid, full-time job for any of us.
