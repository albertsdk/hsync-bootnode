"""QUIC/UDP transport for ``boot/1`` (aioquic).

The transport is a thin adapter around aioquic: it handles the single
QUIC/UDP listener, the mandatory RETRY + address-validation tokens (``retry``
aioquic flag), per-connection peer tracking (STUN-echo source) and the
NDJSON-over-bidi-stream framing. All business rules live in
``hsync_bootnode.handler.BootHandler`` and are fully testable without sockets.

TLS identity: a self-signed certificate built from ``hsync_common.ssl_utils``
(ECDSA P-256 — ADR-0037). It persists by default at a state path (``0600`` in a
``0700`` directory) so its fingerprint is stable and pin-able across restarts;
``run --ephemeral`` keeps it in memory instead. Either way, no peer data is ever
written to disk (no-log).
